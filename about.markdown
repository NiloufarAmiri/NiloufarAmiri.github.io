I am a PhD student in Robotics at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I focus on the dynamic modeling, control, and optimization of mobile soft robots. I hold a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, with a Master’s degree from Shahid Beheshti University and a Bachelor’s degree from Razi University.

Before joining TMU, I was a project manager at Needsanat, a company specializing in technical solutions for industrial equipment. In this role, I led a mechanical engineering team, developed comprehensive technical documentation, and honed my skills in contracting and SEO. Additionally, I worked as a soft robotics researcher at the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, where I designed and fabricated components for rehabilitation robots, utilizing SolidWorks and 3D printing technologies. I have published several papers in reputable journals on soft robots and vibration-driven robots, showcasing my commitment to innovation and engineering.

I am passionate about exploring new frontiers and tackling complex challenges in robotics and automation by applying my skills to advance science and technology.
