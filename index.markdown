## 👋 Welcome

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Website.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="200">

I am a PhD student at the Robotics, Mechatronics, and Automation Laboratory (RMAL) at Toronto Metropolitan University. My research focuses on dynamic modeling, vision-based control, design, and optimization of continuum aerial manipulators. I have a strong background in mechanical engineering, holding both a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in this exciting field.

I am passionate about exploring new frontiers and addressing complex challenges in robotics and automation. I enjoy coding, thinking creatively, and continuously expanding my knowledge in computer vision and electrical hardware to make meaningful contributions to this interdisciplinary field.

I have valuable experience working with soft rehabilitation technologies, including the development of a soft glove orthosis. In addition, I am deeply interested in mentoring and teaching, with extensive experience as a teaching assistant across various engineering courses.
